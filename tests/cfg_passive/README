This configuration is (almost) based on the alignak default configuration.

It defines:

    * a passive host template and some passively checked hosts
    * a passive service template and some passively checked services

Freshness thresholds are defined as quite short durations (10 / 20 seconds) as such the hosts and services will quite rapidly go to their freshness state.
